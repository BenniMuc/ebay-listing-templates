    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt"></span> Description</h4>
    <p>This Onkyo SACD plays CDs and SACDs, and sounds great. I've been the only owner and I've been very happy with it, with one exception. At some point the eject functionality started to get spotty. So the disk with load and play fine, but <b>when it's time to eject sometimes it will not work</b>. The workaround is to open the case (only a few screws) and manually remove the disk, but obviously this is not ideal. I don't want to deal with getting it repaired, but it could be a small thing, and  someone with some skills might be able to fix it for free. The top has a some scratches that you can see in the photos, but nothing major, and nothing from the front. Remote, power cord and original packaging</p>
